# Flask Form Application

## Overview

This is a simple web application built using Flask, HTML, and Python. The application consists of two HTML pages:
- **Form Page** (`form.html`): A page that contains a form with two inputs, one for the user's name and another for their age.
- **Result Page** (`result.html`): A page that displays the output based on the inputs from the form page.
  
The application processes the form data (name and age) using Flask and displays the results on a separate page.

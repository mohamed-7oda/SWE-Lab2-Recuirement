# SWE Lab2

Overview:

This is a simple web application built using Flask, HTML, and Python. The application consists of two HTML pages:
- Form Page (`form.html`): A page that contains a form with two inputs, one for the user's name and another for their age.
- Result Page (`result.html`): A page that displays the output based on the inputs from the form page.
The application processes the form data (name and age) using Flask and displays the results on a separate page.

To run this application, you need to have the following installed:

- Python
- Flask

1) git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2) pip install Flask
3) python app.py
